## Lyrics

```
Got to skip for the waste for today

All my crew on the net, everpresent with 
debt to society we will never repay
Please don't forgive, they'll never learn
so fuck what they say
Fuck what they say

Let me tor out trouble they may
Seemed skeevy for a flat today I'm okay

Better today than ever before 
I fell for that time and again

Imma do as I please
Advice from strangers
Aren't shit for 

Speak before crashing your face

Preaching the faith

Please count what they give

Squad
I better forgive
I better forgive What they say on me
Please do come out and play
I've seen better days
I've seen better days

fuck that
fuck what they say
i tell 

```
