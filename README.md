## Lyrics

```
Got to skip for the waste for today

Let me tor out trouble they may
Seemed skeevy for a flat today I'm okay

Better today than ever before 
I fell for that time and again
Fuck what they say
Fuck what they say
Imma do as I please
Advice from strangers
Aren't the shit for 

Speak before crashing your face

Preaching the faith

Squad
I better forgive
I better forgive What they say on me
Please do come out and play
I've seen better days
I've seen better days
